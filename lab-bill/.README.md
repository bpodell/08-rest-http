This is application is a simulation of an HTTP server.

How to use: either use the applicatin Postman or install HTTPie on your local device.

If using postman: declare your port in your .env file. As of launching the current port is set at 3000. In the postman query line type localhost:3000/api/v1/note. This is your base setup for GET and POST routes.

In the server.test.js we are running jest to test if our files are working properly, both on successful and unsuccessful api calls. We are checking body the body and the status code.
